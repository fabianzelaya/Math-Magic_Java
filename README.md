# Math Magic
Instructions: In this project, you will become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you choose.  The instructions provided are general guidelines. Upon completion of the project, feel free to explore the code on your own.

```java
public class Magic {
  public static void main (String[], arg) {
    int myNumber = 15;
    
    // We will refer to myNumber as the original number from now on.
    
    int stepOne = (myNumber) * (myNumber);
    int stepTwo = (stepTwo) + myNumber;
    int stepThree = (stepTwo) / myNumber;
    int stepFour = (stepThree) + 17;
    int stepFive = (stepFour) - myNumber;
    int stepSix = (stepFive) / 6;
    
    System.out.println(stepFive);
  }
}
// FZ

// Sample output: 18
```
